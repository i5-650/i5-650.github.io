I participated to the [FCSC](https://france-cybersecurity-challenge.fr) for the second time this year. The first time was in 2019 and this I wanted to do better than the previous year. Before starting the CTF I hadn't done any CTF for a while or any cybersecurity related activities so it was a good way to get back into it. 
This post will mostly be useful for myself and also be a write-up for the challenges I have solved and found interesting. 

> Note that I mainlt focused on web challenges as I am more comfortable with this type of challenge. I also did a few others.
